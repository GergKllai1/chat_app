# Basic chat app using Rails ActionCable functionality

We will be building a basic chat app to learn about the [ActionCable functionality](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html) which uses [websockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) protocol.

Our App will have following features:

- User Authentication
- Push notifications in chat windows
- List of chats and list of available users

`Disclaimer: This guide assumes a basic familiarity with rails development, like associations and user authentication.`

## Basic setup

### Redis setup

Redis is a data store that supports the PubSub messaging pattern and one that the ActionCable implementation makes use of.

Install Redis using brew

`$ brew install redis`

Start the Redis server as a service

`$ brew services start redis`

You should also include the redis gem in your application by adding:

`gem 'redis'`

Follow up by running:

`bundle`

After that you have to configure redis. Add the following code to `config/cable.yml`

````ruby
redis: &redis
  adapter: redis
  url: redis://localhost:6379/1
production: *redis
development: *redis
test: *redis```

````

### Scaffold a rails application

First scaffold basic rails app

`rails new chat_app --database=postgresql --skip-test --skip-bundle`

Clean up the usual files.

### Set up testing

Set up [Cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-rails) for testing.
We set up a feature file to make sure two users can chat with each other, and others cannot access the chat.

```gerkin
# features/live_chat_functionality.feature

@javascript
Feature: LiveChat allows users to exchange messages
    As a user
    In order to chat with other users
    I want a live chat feature

    Background:
        Given the following users exist
            | email             |
            | user-1@random.com |
            | user-2@random.com |
            | user-3@random.com |

        And I am logged in as "user-1@random.com"
        And I visit the site
        And I click on "user-2@random.com"

    Scenario: Users can exchange messages
        Given I fill in "Hello!" in "message_text"
        And I click on 'Send'
        And I open a new window
        And I log in as "user-2@random.com"
        And I visit the site
        And I click on "Chat with user-1@random.com"
        Then I should see "Chat with: user-1@random.com"
        Then I should see "Hello!"
        And I fill in "Hello there!" in "message_text"
        And I click on 'Send'
        And I switch to window 1
        And I should see "Hello there!"

    Scenario: Other users cannot see the chat

        Given I open a new window
        And I log in as "user-3@random.com"
        And I visit the site
        Then I should not see "join"
```

This one is tricky to test, because we have to manage multiple users logged into multiple windows. Makes it even more fun when we will eventually get it to work!

Add following chrome options to cucumber `env.rb`

```ruby
#features/support/env.rb
Cucumber::Rails::Database.javascript_strategy = :truncation

Chromedriver.set_version '2.42'

chrome_options = %w[no-sandbox disable-popup-blocking disable-infobars]

chrome_options << 'headless'

Capybara.register_driver :selenium do |app|
    options = Selenium::WebDriver::Chrome::Options.new(
        args: chrome_options
)
Capybara::Selenium::Driver.new(
        app,
        browser: :chrome,
        options: options
)
end
```

Create `basic_steps.rb` and `assertion_steps.rb` step definition files and store the step definitions appropriately.

Let's start by running cucumber. Fill in the step definition as:

```ruby
#features/step_definitions/basic_steps.rb
Given("the following users exist") do |table|
    table.hashes.each do |user|
        create(:user, user)
    end
end
```

To get it to work, we need to add the line `World(FactoryBot::Syntax::Methods)` to our `features/support/env.rb` file.

It will now complain about lack of users in our code.

### Set up Devise

Set up [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) which will be used for user creation/authentication.

After the set up, make sure you have a **User** model and a working factory for user.

Now that we have users in the system, we need to add chat and messaging functionality.

### Generate models

Now comes the fun part!
We will need two models other then the **User** model generated by devise: **Chat** and **Message** .

**Chat** model will be empty and **Message** model will have a 'text' column with string datatype.

Use the following commands:

`rails g model Chat` and `rails g model Message text:string`

to generate each.

### Set up associations

Now is the time to add associations!

1. **Chats** and **Messages** have `has_many` & `belongs_to` associations.
2. **Users** and **Messages** have `has_many` & `belongs-to` associations.
3. **Chats** and **Users** have `has_many_and_belongs_to` association(!).

To do this run the following commands:

```rails
rails g migration CreateJoinTableUserChat user chat
rails g migration AddUserRefToMessages user:references
rails g migration AddChatRefToMessages chat:references
rails db:migrate
```

And add the associations:

```ruby
#app/models/chat.rb
class Chat < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :users
  has_many :messages
end
```

```ruby
#app/models/message.rb
class Message < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :chat
  belongs_to :user
end
```

```ruby
#app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # Include default devise modules. Others available are:
  # :confirmable, :lockable, :timeoutable, :trackable and :omniauthable
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :validatable
  has_and_belongs_to_many :chats
  has_many :messages
end
```

### Set up Chat controller and starter views

Set up chat and messages controllers with basic index and show action. Create `chat_controller.rb` with the following code:

```ruby
#app/controllers/chat_controller.rb
class ChatController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @chats = current_user.chats
  end

  def show
      @messages = Message.where(chat_id: params[:id])
    end
end
```

Set up routes in `routes.rb`. We will use `chat#index` as root path.

```ruby
#config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root controller: :chat, action: :index
  devise_for :users
  resources :chat, only: [:index, :show]
end
```

And to finish off add 3 views to start with. First we add a navbar partial and render it in `chat#index` so that we are able to log in and out

```ruby
#app/views/partials/_navbar.html.haml
=link_to 'Home', root_path
-unless user_signed_in?
  =link_to 'Register', new_user_registration_path
  =link_to 'Login', new_user_session_path
- else
  =link_to 'Logout', destroy_user_session_path, { method: :delete }
  %span=current_user.email
```

After that we add the index view for chat:

```ruby
#app/view/chat/index.html.haml
= render partial: 'partials/navbar'

-@chats.each do |chat|
  =link_to "Chat between #{chat.users.first.email} and #{chat.users.second.email}", chat_path(chat.id)
```

To finish up this we need to add the chat show page as well:

```ruby
#app/view/chat/show.html.haml
-@messages.each do |message|
  %p= "#{message.user.email} says: #{message.text}"
```

To see this in action we need to add some data, the easiest way is through the seed file. Let's add the following code to it:

```Ruby
#db/seed.rb
Message.destroy_all
Chat.destroy_all
User.destroy_all

user1 = User.create(email: 'user1@mail.com', password:'password')
user2 = User.create(email: 'user2@mail.com', password:'password')
user3 = User.create(email: 'user3@mail.com', password:'password')

chat_1 = Chat.create()
chat_1.users << user1
chat_1.users << user2

chat_2 = Chat.create()
chat_2.users << user1
chat_2.users << user3
```

Now if you run `rails db:seed` and `rails s` you should be able to login and see 2 chat links for user1.

### Create Message controller

Now we should continue by adding a `message_controller` with only create action. For this implementation we will use `chat#show` to render the message form.

Add the following file:

```ruby
#app/controllers/message_controller
class MessageController < ApplicationController
  def create
    message = current_user.messages.new(message_params)
    chat = Chat.find_by_id(message_params[:chat_id])
    if message.save
      redirect_to chat_path(chat)
    end
  end

  private

  def message_params
    params.require(:message).permit(:text, :chat_id)
  end
end
```

The `message = current_user.messages.new(message_params)` uses the `has_many` association to create a message connected to the current user already, which makes for a drier code.

Add the path to the `routes.rb`:

```ruby
#config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root controller: :chat, action: :index
  devise_for :users
  resources :chat, only: [:index, :show]
  resources :message, only: [:create]
end
```

And finally add the form to the `chat#show` view:

```ruby
#app/view/chat/show.html.haml
-@messages.each do |message|
  %p= "#{message.user.email} says: #{message.text}"

= form_with scope: :message, url: message_index_path, id: :chat_form do | form |
  %p
    = form.label 'Send Message'
    %br/
    = form.text_field :text
    = form.hidden_field :chat_id, value: @chat.id,id: :chat_id
  %p
    = form.submit "Send"
```

We need to pass down the `chat_id` using a hidden field so the message can be connected to the chat.

Now we have a chat with 2 users, and a form where we can create messages. We render those messages in the `chat#show`, and when you type you see them appearing. This is because rails redirects us to that page and fetches the information again. That is not the behaviour we are looking for, we need to show them appear dynamically. This is where ActionCable comes into play.

## Set up ActionCable

Add ActionCable engine to your `routes.rb`

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount ActionCable.server => '/cable'
end
```

Use a generator to scaffold a channel

`rails g channel chat`

Update subscribed method in channel settings like so:

```ruby
#app/channels/chat_channel.rb
class ChatChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
  def subscribed
    stream_from channel_identifier
  end
  
  def unsubscribed
    # Any cleanup needed when channel is unsubscribed
  end

  private

  def channel_identifier
    identifier = params[:chat_id]
    "chat_channel_#{identifier}"
  end
end
```

We are creating unique chat channel for every pair of users, and we need a method to subscribe to specific channel based on the logged in user and the partner selected.

Time to update javascript file generated for us:

```javascript
#app/assets/javascripts/channels/chat.js

document.addEventListener('turbolinks:load', () =>{
    let chatForm = document.getElementById('chat_form');
    if (chatForm) {
        const chatId = document.getElementById('chat_id').value
        const currentUserEmail = document.getElementById('current_user_email').value
        App.notifications = App.cable.subscriptions.create({
            channel: "ChatChannel", chat_id: chatId
          }, {
                container() {
                    const container = document.getElementById('message_window');
                    return container;
                },
                connected() {
                    console.log(`Connected to message:chat_${chatId}`);
                },
                disconnected() {
                    console.log('Disconneced');
                },
                received(data) {
                    let node = document.createElement('p');
                    node.className= data.from === currentUserEmail ? 'send-message' : 'receive-message'
                    node.innerText = `${data.message}`;
                    this.container().appendChild(node);
                },
            }
          );  
    };
});
```

This needs some explanation!

At the core of the file is the `App.cable.subscriptions.create` command, which creates notifications and updates the page through `received(data)` function by adding an HTML element to the page everytime a new message is received.

This is controlled by identifying `chatId` which we source from our chat form.

Now, in order to get that `chatId` we have to make sure the `chatForm` exists on the view page,so we make sure page is loaded and form exists by wrapping the whole thing in event listeners.
